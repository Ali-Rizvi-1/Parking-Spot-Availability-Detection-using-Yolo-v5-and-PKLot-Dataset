# Parking Spot Availability Detection using Yolo v5 and PKLot Dataset
 This repository contains the code for parking spot availability detection using Yolo version 5. The pretrained model is further trained on the PKLot dataset.
 
# About Dataset:
The PKLot dataset contains 12,416 images of parking lots extracted from surveilance camera frames.
There are images on sunny, cloudy, and rainy days and the parking spaces are labeled as occupied or
empty. We have converted the original annotations to a variety of standard object detection formats by
enclosing a bounding box around the original dataset's rotated rectangle annotations.
